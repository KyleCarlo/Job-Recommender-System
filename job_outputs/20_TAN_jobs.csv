Online Teacher &amp; Research Assistant (Math and English Language Arts),Modulo Learning Inc,https://ph.jobstreet.com/job/83011115?type=standard&ref=search-standalone&origin=cardTitle#sol=735679538db32be1fd5b97fadf92b9b2b5b4605f,"Full-Time Online Substitute Teacher &amp; Research AssistantSummary:&nbsp;Full-time remote role. Hours may vary but typically 11-2pm and 4:30-10pm Eastern Standard Time (NYC), Tues-Saturday&nbsp;The Modulo substitute teacher will be on call to step in at the last minute to teach any subjects PreK-12th grade including early literacy, advanced essay writing and advanced math. Most of the time, when not subbing, the substitute teacher will help Modulo with research and administrative tasks, researching homeschool programs to include in our marketplace,&nbsp; assisting us with running day to day operations of Modulo. The person needs to be highly flexible, good under pressure, easy to work with,&nbsp;extremely dependable, well organized with very strong teaching and research skills, as well as perfect English skills (verbal and written). Since you’re the sub, it’s very important that you are not the type of person who cancels or needs to reschedule due to personal or work emergencies, and can make a one-year commitment. Since this role involves online teaching, you must have a high-speed internet connection and experience teaching online. While you don’t have to be an expert in every subject, you’re the kind of teacher who can support a child’s learning in any subject by asking the right questions and identifying tools to support them.&nbsp;Typical hours are 11am-2pm and 4:30-10pm Eastern Standard time (NYC) Tuesday through Saturday, though that may vary.&nbsp;More About the Role:Modulo tutors sometimes cancel at the last minute, and we need to be sure we always have a sub for all subjects, especially upper elementary literacy (math and ELA), as well as middle school and high school math and ELA. This role requires someone who is very strong at PreK-12th grade math and ELA can step in at a moment’s notice to support students across a variety of subjects while maintaining Modulo’s child-centered, growth-focused learning approach.We are looking for a&nbsp;full-time substitute teacher for online tutoring in PreK-12th grade who is dependable, highly skilled, and flexible. This requires a special person with advanced math skills (who can teach through high school), a fully fluent English speaker or completely bilingual who can help with advanced essay writing, and also extremely comfortable with very young children for early childhood math and literacy. They are as at ease teaching reading as they are, guiding students through Biology and Calculus. As many of our kids are gifted or have special needs, the tutor should be adaptable. You don’t need to be an expert in every subject, but have enough knowledge to guide children’s learning.&nbsp; Our tutors guide students through curriculum designed for homeschoolers, so you don’t have to prepare your own curriculum.&nbsp;Modulo’s tutoring approach is different from other companies. We want to raise auto-didacts, capable of directing their own learning in a changing world. We believe teachers should take the role of guides, not instructors, guiding students through curriculum or learning apps, asking the right questions and helping them learn to learn, rather than teaching them how to do things or giving the answers..&nbsp;&nbsp;Since you are mostly on-call for teaching, the rest of the time, when not teaching, you will be doing research for Modulo’s growing homeschooling marketplace, finding and vetting online and local programs we can add to our marketplace. This will involve identifying programs in local and online homeschool groups on Facebook and Reddit, outreach to programs, and evaluating their pros and cons. You may also be asked to assist with other administrative aspects of running Modulo such as hiring tutors or helping our head of learning or administrative assistant.&nbsp;About Modulo:Modulo is a dynamic marketplace for homeschooling, designed to give families access to high-quality, vetted educational resources that fit their unique learning needs. Inspired by the innovations in homeschooling and modular learning, Modulo moves beyond the traditional one-size-fits-all model, allowing students to build customized learning pathways. Our platform connects families with expert educators, engaging curricula, and a supportive community, ensuring that all learners—especially those who have been historically underserved—can thrive. Whether a child is profoundly gifted, neurodivergent, or simply looking for an alternative to conventional schooling, Modulo provides the tools and flexibility to make learning work for them.Hours:Must be available during&nbsp;Pacific Standard Time (PST)Sample schedule:&nbsp;11 AM – 2 PM and&nbsp;4:30 PM – 11:30 PM PST (exact hours may vary depending when sub needs to be on call 35-40 hrs/week), Tuesday-SundayThis should be your primary focus—availability and reliability are keyKey Responsibilities:Substitute Teaching: Step in for various subjects, including:Math (PreK-12th grade, including Algebra, Geometry, and Calculus)ELA (PreK-12th grade English Language Arts, including tutoring gifted students)Early Literacy &amp; Foundational Math (For younger students)Science (Middle school level)Python Coding (Preferred but not required)Basic Digital Art (Helpful but not required)Adaptive Teaching Approach: Follow the&nbsp;child-led, growth mindset approach—supporting students as they navigate their curriculum rather than taking a traditional, teacher-centered role.Collaboration: Communicate effectively with primary teachers to understand lesson plans and student needs.Resource Curation: When not teaching, help&nbsp;research and add the best homeschooling resources to our Modulo marketplace, focusing on different cities like New York and Dallas.Who We’re Looking For:Dependable &amp; Committed: This must be your main role. We need someone who shows up, even if they’re under the weather.Strong English Proficiency: Must have excellent grammar and the ability to tutor SAT-level English. A light accent is fine, as long as communication is clear.Math Expertise: Must be comfortable teaching up to&nbsp;Calculus.Great with Kids: Ability to engage&nbsp;both younger children and teens, adapting to different learning styles.Tech-Ready: Reliable&nbsp;high-speed internet and a&nbsp;decent computer are required.Flexible &amp; Curious: Willing to step into different subjects, guide students effectively, and embrace Modulo’s unique approach to learning.Experience with Neurodiverse Learners: Many of our students are&nbsp;profoundly gifted, have ADHD, or are on the autism spectrum—familiarity with diverse learning needs is a plus.We are open to&nbsp;any gender for this role, though we acknowledge that some students have preferences. Ultimately, we’re looking for the right&nbsp;personality fit—someone&nbsp;kind, funny, adaptable, and organized.If this sounds like you, we’d love to hear from you!",Education,"Manila City, National Capital Region (NCR)",Full-time,Jobstreet,
